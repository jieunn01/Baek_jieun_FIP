## Brand story
Think about when we use palettes. 
The colors are organized all at once so we can match the color combination without difficulty. Like this, palette gives us convenience. Our brand, inspired by this, deals with a package that consists of base cosmetics and various color cosmetics at once, depending on your skin tone. Package components will be recommended for your skin tone and purpose. Also, by using the package, we can offer it at a lower price than individual purchases. First palette is your choices and we hope your second palette will be made from us.
